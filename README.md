# libhat
# This is a project of the UP School of Library and Information Studies.
# The code is meant for a Raspberry Pi and interfaces with external sensors using the GPIO to gather environmental and user data used for service improvement in heritage organisations.

# User statistics module
#   Monitors monthly user figures (entering the main doors of the library)

# Noise level response module
#   Monitors the noise level in a reading room and delivers a warning above threshold.

# Environmental monitoring modules
#   Temperature and Humidity monitor
#     Monitors temperature and humidity for preservation planning. Delivers a warning when exceeding set threshold.

#   Light level monitor
#     Triggers light fixtures to maintain a comfortable reading level in response to changes in natural lighting.
#     Monitors light levels for preservation planning. Delivers a warning when exceeding set threshold.

#   Shock sensing
#     Monitors occasional shocks and tremors for preservation planning, such as users bumping into bookshelves or a large book being slammed.
#     Triggers an evacuation alarm or duck-cover-hold warning upon detection of continuous shocks.

#   Smoke detection
#     Triggers an alarm upon detection of smoke.
